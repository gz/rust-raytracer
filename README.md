# Raytracers in Rust

This repo contains a few very basic raytracer implementations written in Rust:

 * raytracer_2d.rs: Uses an orthographic camera to produce a 2D image.

The code is inspired by the book [Realistic Ray Tracing (2nd Edition)][2] by Peter Shirley and R. Keith Morley and the [smallpt][1] project.
