# Raytracers in Rust

This repo contains a few very basic raytracer implementations written in Rust:

 * raytracer_2d.rs: Ver simple raytracer that produces a 2D image with orthographic projection.
 * raytracer_pinhole.rs: Similar to the one above but now adds a pinhole camera.

The code is inspired by the book [Realistic Ray Tracing (2nd Edition)][2] by Peter Shirley and R. Keith Morley and the [smallpt][1] project.
